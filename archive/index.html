            we did not have a computer that could play the new games.  3.1  and a very old computer were no match for the likes of some of thses 95 games.  so i only got to play them at the store or at other peoples houses.  when i was in 4th grade we moved from the town i was born in to the town right next door because my parents wanted us to go to the better school but at the same time have a better house and better community.  we moved into a culdisac and on one of the ends of our circle was a family that had a pimp machine the year after 95 came out.  i used to go over there and just play games and mess around on their computer.  then ali spalter... 

when i used to play on other peoples computers it felt cold and weird... i loved machines and radios and electronics but something about a computer running always made me feel different.  its that feeling you have when you're coming up on a trip or when you're deeply in love and you embrace that "the one"* .. but now i can't live without it... it makes me feel warm and happy... its my window to the world, my window to reality (lol), my precious. 

i have gone without the internet for a  few days before.  it was very hard.  then when i moved to chicago after college, i had almost 6 weeks without internet.  I played hella single player games but found myself going out more.  in going out, id end up going to internet cafes just to get online to chat with people and get new episodes and software.  when we first moved in we were trying to get 20mbit cable w/2m up from.. but it fell through as rcn couldnt service our building... then comcast wouldnt service our building.  then  atnt wouldnt srevice our building.  we had nothign.  it took us almost 2 months to get one tech from any of the 3 major isps to even come survey our building.  what a gfucking joke.
