            <h2>Comments</h2>
            <p>When visitors leave comments on this site we collect the  data shown in the comments form, and also the visitor’s IP address and  browser user agent string to help spam detection.</p>
            <p>An anonymized string created from your email address (also  called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are using it.

            <h2>Media</h2>
            <p>If you upload images to the website, including your avatar  (id you create one), you should avoid uploading images with embedded  location data (EXIF GPS) included. Visitors to the website can download  and extract any location data from images on the website.</p>
            <h2>Cookies</h2>
            <p>If you leave a comment on our site you may opt-in to saving  your name, email address and website in cookies.

            <h2>Embedded content from other websites</h2>
            <p>Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g.  videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites  behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other  website.</p>
            <p>These websites may collect data about you, use cookies,  embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the  embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that  website.</p>

            <h2>How long we retain your data</h2>
            <p>If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are  retained indefinitely. This is so we can recognize and approve any  follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.</p>
            <p>For users that register on our website (if any), we also  store the personal information they provide in their user profile. All  users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time  (except they cannot change their username). Website administrators can  also see and edit that information.</p>
            <h2>What rights you have over your data</h2>
            <p>If you have an account on this site, or have left comments,  you can request to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also  request that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or  security purposes.</p>
            <h2>Where we send your data</h2>
            <p>Visitor comments, which are currently disabled, may be  checked through an automated spam detection service.  Registered user  comments are never sent through this service.</p>
