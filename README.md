# zorz.org README

## What

This repository contains the code for my site (zorz.org), which I initially had as a WordPress site but decided I hate JS so I'm writing from scratch in just pure HTML and CSS for the main pages.  

## Why
Because, fuck JavaScript and what it has done to the web.  Yes, I understand how incredibly useful it is for rich and interactive web and app interfaces but the exploitation by advertisers and others just makes it disgusting to me.  

## Next Steps/To-Do:
- [ ] Complete menu
- [ ] Finish design
- [ ] Decide on fonts
- [ ] Create various sites
- [ ] Set license
- [ ]
